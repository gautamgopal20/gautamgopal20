        <h1>Travel to Antartica</h1>
        <h2><strong>About</strong></h2>
        <p id="para-gg">
        Antarctica, the southernmost continent and site of the South Pole, is a virtually uninhabited, ice-covered landmass. Most cruises to the continent visit the Antarctic Peninsula, which stretches toward South America. It’s known for the Lemaire Channel and Paradise Harbor, striking, iceberg-flanked passageways, and Port Lockroy, a former British research station turned museum. The peninsula’s isolated terrain also shelters rich wildlife, including many penguins.</p>
        <h2>Population</h2>
        <p>1,000 to 5,000 depending on season</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>

            <p>There are seven sovereign states who have made eight territorial claims in Antarctica: Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. These countries have tended to place their Antarctic scientific observation and study facilities within their respective claimed territories; however, a number of such facilities are located outside of the area claimed by their respective countries of operation, and countries without claims such as India, Russia and the United States have constructed research facilities within the areas claimed by other countries.</p>
